MMP100 Final Project: The Buns

I chose to create a story game about a bun attempting to escape from hungry enemies. I chose p5 for its
great interactive features, allowing players to engage with my story. I used a bun store background, cute sounds,
and character drawings to make a happy and light-hearted feel. This makes players enjoy the game and gets 
them into the fun world of Bun's escape. The most challenging part of the project was setting up the game 
details with p5 and making sure the code worked well together. I spent a lot of time fixing them.
